# [Vintage Couture Sales Analysis](https://debayo-arch.github.io/Adebayo-s-Portfolio/)

## Overview 
This is the first project i did during my internship at Dataleum Academy.
This project analyzes sales data for **Vintage Couture**, a boutique retailer of vintage clothing, to uncover insights into revenue trends, customer demographics, and sales performance. The goal is to support data-driven decisions in inventory, marketing, and customer engagement using visualizations and an interactive dashboard.

## Key Findings
1.	The 18–30 age group (Young Adults) contributed the highest revenue among all customer segments, indicating strong engagement from younger customers.
2.	The Online Channel generated more revenue than both the Store and Vendor Channels, highlighting a shift in customer preference toward digital shopping platforms.
3.	Out of the total customers, 1,512 women and 751 men contributed to sales, indicating that women accounted for over 66% of total customer participation. This suggests a stronger market engagement among female customers.
4.	The South-South region generated the highest revenue of ₦5,397,394.00, significantly outperforming the South-West region, which recorded the lowest revenue of ₦733,282.00. This reveals a substantial regional revenue gap of over ₦4.6 million, indicating stronger market activity in the South-South zone.
